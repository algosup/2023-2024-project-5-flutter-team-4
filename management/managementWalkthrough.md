This document is a walkthrough of the management artifacts of the project. It will guide you through the different documents that have been created to manage the project, providing a recommended order in which to read them.

## 1. GitHub Management

We use GitHub as a common platform for our project, we decided to use it for management documents as well. [GitHub Issues]() will be used to track tasks and bugs, [GitHub Projects]() will be used to manage the project and see the tasks timeline.

## 2. Recommended order to read the documents

### 2.1. Project Charter

The first document you should read is the [Project Charter](management_artifacts/project_charter.md). This document provides an overview of the project, including the project purpose, scope, milestones, team, stakeholders, responsibilities, risks, constraints, and overall plan. You will get a good understanding of the project by reading this document.

### 2.2. Gantt Chart

[Gantt Chart](https://github.com/orgs/algosup/projects/34/views/4): This document provides a visual representation of the project timeline, including the start and end dates of each task. You should read this document after the Project Charter to get a detailed view of the project schedule.

### 2.3. Milestones

We will use GitHub Issues milestones to track the progress of the project. We grouped the milestones by category, for example Documentation. You can find the milestones [here](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-5-flutter-team-4/milestones).

### 2.4. KPIs

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are metrics that help us measure the success of the project. You can find the KPIs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nz-Y2kKFS27_df2ZR5rkcQQ4xzIw789UHDA-D6zhS4g/edit?usp=sharing).

### 2.5. RACI Matrix

The RACI Matrix is a tool used to define roles and responsibilities for each task in the project. You can find the RACI Matrix [here](management_artifacts/RACI_Matrix.pdf).

### 2.6. Risk Management

Now that you are aware of the responsibilities of each team member, you should read the [Risk Management](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13ppuQtH63KG5h03xVnGx2j9pGNSQNAlM/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117083838720275060736&rtpof=true&sd=true) document. This document outlines the risks associated with the project and the mitigation strategies that have been put in place to address them.

### 2.7. Weekly Reports

Every week, the team will create a Weekly Report to summarize the work done during the week, accompanied with a feedback of the team about the current feeling about the project. You can find the Weekly Reports [here](management_artifacts/weekly_reports).
