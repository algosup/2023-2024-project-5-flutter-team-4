This document is a walkthrough of the management artifacts of the project. It will guide you through the different documents that have been created to manage the project, providing a recommended order in which to read them.

## 1. GitHub Management

We use GitHub as a common platform for our project, we decided to use it for management documents as well. [GitHub Issues]() will be used to track tasks and bugs, [GitHub Projects]() will be used to manage the project and see the tasks timeline.

## 2. Recommended order to read the documents

### 2.1. Project Charter

[Project Charter](management_artifacts/project_charter.md): This document provides an overview of the project, including the project purpose, scope, milestones, team, stakeholders, responsibilities, risks, constraints, and overall plan. You should read this document first to get a high-level understanding of what the project is about.

### 2.2. Gantt Chart

### 2.3. Milestones

We will use GitHub Issues milestones to track the progress of the project. We grouped the milestones by category, for example Documentation. You can find the milestones [here](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-5-flutter-team-4/milestones).
