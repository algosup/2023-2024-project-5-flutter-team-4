## Purpose

The purpose of this code of conduct is to establish a set of guidelines for our team to follow. These guidelines will help us to work together effectively and respectfully.

## 1. Respect

We are all here to learn and grow. We will respect each other's opinions, ideas, and backgrounds. We will listen to each other and treat each other with kindness and understanding. We will not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or bullying. 

## 2. Communication

We will use English as our primary language for communication.

## 3. Absences

If you are unable to attend a project time, please let the team know as soon as possible. We will work together to find a solution that works for everyone. Please do not miss more than two meetings without a valid reason, otherwise, you may receive a warning.

## 4. Lateness

Lateness is not acceptable. If you are going to be late to a project time, please let the team know as soon as possible. If you are late more than twice without a valid reason, you may receive a warning.

## 5. Warning system

The warning system is in place to ensure that everyone is held accountable for their actions. It is as follows:

- First warning: verbal warning
- Second warning: written warning
- Third warning: meeting with Franck, including the team leader and the team member in question
