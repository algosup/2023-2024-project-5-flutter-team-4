### Constraints

We got a few constraints for this project:

- The application must be compatible with phones, tablets and computers.

### Overall plan

In order to get a successful project, we will follow the plan below:

1. We will start by defining the functional specifications of the application and the needs of the client. We will also brainstorm on the features that the application should have.

2. We will then define the technical specifications of the application and the architecture of the application.

3. The team will develop the application, create the tests and write the user manual.

4. The code will be reviewed by the technical leader and the quality assurance engineer.

5. The application will be delivered to the client.
