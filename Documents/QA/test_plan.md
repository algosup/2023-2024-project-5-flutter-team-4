## 1. Testing strategy

For this project, the main strategy regarding testing will be manual testing, as this project is mainly graphical. 

The first tests will include Unit testing to make sure crucial functions such as the multiple parsers, graphs or more. 

## 2. Scopes 

The project contains multiple tests that can be performed but to permit our team to focus on the most important tasks, some tests will be classified as "out of scope". The features contained in the "out of scope" sections are one of the following types of features:

- Features that have not been requested by the client,
- Features that do not interfere with the user's experience,
- Anything related to the backed but the parsers
