## 1. Product analysis

### 1.1 Overview


This project, given by Wevolution, aims to create a job dating platform inspired by popular apps similar to Tinder to permit people searching for a job to get a job interview in a short time with low effort. 

To avoid any form of discrimination, all candidates shall remain anonymous. Candidate profiles will only include soft skills and additional information provided by the candidates, encouraging recruiters to focus on these aspects. Hard skills will not be displayed, as the app is designed for temporary or low-requirement jobs.

## 2 Strategy

For this project, the main strategy regarding testing will be manual testing, as this project is mainly graphical. 

The first tests will include Unit testing to make sure crucial functions such as the multiple parsers, graphs or more. 

### 2.1 Scopes
