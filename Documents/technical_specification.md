### I. Introduction of the project

#### A. Client

[We Are Evolution](https://www.we-are-evolution.com) is a company specialized in the management and business advices since 2019. They help companies to recruit with original tools to meet the challenges of Human Resources.

#### B. Goal of the project

Adopte Un Candidat is a Â« Tinder style Â» recruitment application that matches companies with jobseekers in a different way.
The concept is to promote fair recruitment by anonymizing candidates and companies, promoting soft skills[^1], emphasizing the human aspect of the process and facilitating connections between candidates and companies via a dedicated application.

### II. Solution

#### A. Descritpion

The key points of the Adopte un Candidat concept are as follows:

- To avoid discrimination in hiring, candidates and companies are anonymized on the platform. This allows us to focus on candidates' skills and potential, rather than their origin, gender, age, etc.
- Instead of focusing only on diplomas and professional experience, the concept emphasizes  soft  skills,  i.e.  the  behavioral  and  relational  skills  of  candidates.  This  makes it possible  to  recognize  and  evaluate skills such as communication, teamwork, creativity, problem-solving[^2], etc.
- The concept emphasizes the human aspect of recruitment, recognizing that each candidate has unique talents and skills to offer. It seeks to give each individual the opportunity to showcase his or her skills, regardless of background or academic credentials.
- The "matching" process enables candidates and companies to connect and find an ideal match. Candidates can express their preferences in terms of companies and positions, and companies can search for candidates who match their cultural and organizational needs.
- The entire recruitment process takes place on a dedicated application. This facilitates interaction between candidates and companies, offering features such as messaging, personalized profiles, etc.
- In our approach, we don't have tests, quizzes, or games. Instead, candidates will have the opportunity to select their soft skills from a provided list, while recruiters will choose the desired skills from the same list. The "match" will occur when there is a 50% overlap of soft skills between the candidate and the company. Our concept is inspired by the functionality of the "Tinder" application for recruitment. There is no document or defined skills matrix.

#### B. Operating environment

The application is developed on Windows and Macintosh and it must be compatible with Android, iOS, Windows, Macintosh, tablet, etc.
The development language used is [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev)[^3].

#### D. Contraints

The first constraints that we have on this project is total creative freedom. It's really complexe to work on an idea define by the client without base/visual of what they expected with precision.

#### E. Risks and assumptions

With the amount of functionality defined and the limited time given, the first risk of our project is that it will be too ambitious. To do this, we have defined an order of importance for the features, allowing a reduced selection between what needs to be present for V1 and what needs to be improved for V2.
As the customer is not clear about what he wants and leaves us full creative freedom, we run the risk of not being in the customer's final preferences. For this reason, we produce several mock-ups in order to offer a wide choice that will please the customer.

### III. Technical Specifications

#### A. Graphic convention

. <!-- TODO -->

#### B. Writing convention

The Flutter language has certain conventions that must be respected, which are detailed below:

| NOTATION NAME | DESCRIPTION | USAGE | EXAMPLE |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | - |
| Pascal Casing | we attach each word and capitalize each first letter of words to know where the next word starts | naming Classes | PascalCase |
|  |  | naming Widgets |  |
|  |  | naming Types |  |
|  |  | naming Extensions |  |
| Camel Casing | we attach each word and capitalize each first letter of words except the first one to know where the next word starts | naming Functions | camelCase |
|  |  | naming Variables |  |
|  |  | naming Arguments |  |
| Snake Casing | use the underscore between words written in lower case | naming folders and files | snake_case |
|  |  | naming imports |  |
| Comments | start each line with two slashes and an uppercase letter and finish the comment by a period. | give more information of the code | <pre>```// The following declaration creates a query. It does not run the query.```</pre> |

### IV Program architecture diagram

![Program Architecture Diagram](img/)

### V. Further considerations

#### A. Cost estimate

We have defined an hourly working time of 59.5 hours. This forecast doesn't include overtime.
For the manufacture of the product, it's important to take into account the cost of the host to put the application online and the cloud to back up the data.

#### B. Performance

A high-performance application is one that works the way users want it to. That's why we've focused on providing as many features as possible that will appeal to as many people as possible.
The weight of the application on installation must be less than 500 MB to promote performance and must also respond quickly to user requests without any problems (0.1s for immediate printing, -1s so that the delay is not annoying, and -10s so that the tolerance threshold is not exceeded).

#### C. Security

Adherence to laws, regulations, and standards must be taken into consideration. Focusing on European and French regulations is usually a good start since they are more strict than other regulations.

Here are the regulations that will apply to this product:

##### 1. Personal Data Protection

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: Any application collecting personal data must comply with the GDPR, which imposes strict rules on the collection, processing, storage, and protection of personal data.

- **CNIL (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des LibertÃ©s)**: The customer must declare the data processing activities to the CNIL and adhere to its recommendations. It is crucial to ensure users' rights (right of access, rectification, deletion, etc.).

*source: [European Union](https://gdpr.eu/checklist/) / [CNIL](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/les-outils-de-la-conformite)*

##### 2. Transparency

- **Obligation to Inform**: Users will be clearly and transparently informed about how their data will be used, who will have access to it, and for what purposes. This includes having an accessible and understandable privacy policy.
- **Cookies and Trackers**: Cookies will be used to understand how the app is used by the users and to collect insights that will help to improve the product. A cookie consent/manager will be included with the product.

##### 3. Non-Discrimination

- **Labor Code**: It prohibits any form of discrimination in hiring based on criteria such as age, sex, origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, etc. Explainable AI and thoughtful iteration and design helped mitigate this issue.
- **Law for the Freedom to Choose One's Professional Future**: It reinforces employers' obligations to combat discrimination and promote professional equality.
- **Diversity Charter**: Although not legally binding, adhering to this charter can demonstrate your commitment to promoting diversity.

*source: [MinistÃ¨re du Travail](https://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/loi_pour_la_liberte_de_choisir_son_avenir_professionnel-2.pdf) / [Charte de la DiversitÃ©](https://www.charte-diversite.com/)*

##### 4. Fair Access to Employment

- **Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy**: It imposes obligations of fairness and transparency in digital services, including recruitment platforms.
- **Anti-Discrimination Law**: We must ensure that your algorithm and platform do not indirectly discriminate against certain groups of candidates. For example, it is prohibited to filter applications based on discriminatory criteria.

*source: [Legifrance](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000000801164) / [Legifrance](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000018877783)*

##### 5. Consent and Right to be Forgotten

- **Explicit Consent**: Users must give explicit consent for the processing of their data, especially if it involves sensitive data.
- **Right to be Forgotten**: Users must be able to request the deletion of their personal data, and you must be able to comply with this request within the specified time frames.

##### 6. Data Security

- **Security Measures**: In the future, we plan to implement technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of personal data, such as encryption, access controls, etc. A good rule of thumb is to always respecting the CIA principles[^4]

##### 7. Contractual Obligations

- **Terms and Conditions (T&Cs)**: These must be clear and accepted by users, defining the rights and obligations of each party.
- **Contracts with Recruiters**: Contracts should stipulate responsibilities regarding data processing and compliance with anti-discrimination laws.

##### 8. Localization and Internationalization

The product has been thought for the global market, but focuses on the French market for now.
The product will have to include French and English languages for the minimum viable product.

#### D. Accessibility

As of now, only color-blindness and visual impairment have been taken into consideration, but eventually it would be commendable to follow the [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)

This former has been mitigated by using an app named Daltonize Me to simulate all the variations of color-blindness and ensure that no element of the design depended purely on color perception.

The latter consisted of using the `alt` properties of images to enable text to speech to describe them with more ease.

### VI. Success evaluation

In order to evaluate the performance of the app and its features and to make it evolve, several metrics can be monitored. Here are some that might be interesting to consider in the future:

- **Time-to-Hire**: The average time it takes from the job posting to the candidate's acceptance of the job offer.
- **Time-to-Fill**: The time taken to fill a position from the moment it was approved to be filled.
- **Time-to-Screen**: The time taken to review and screen candidates after they apply.
- **Cost-per-Hire**: The total cost incurred to hire a candidate, including advertising, recruiter fees, and other expenses.
- **Candidate Satisfaction Score**: Use surveys to measure candidates' satisfaction with the recruitment process.
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Ask candidates if they would recommend your recruitment platform to others.
- **Application Completion Rate**: The percentage of candidates who complete the application process once they start.
- **Offer Acceptance Rate**: The percentage of candidates who accept job offers.
- **Recruiter Productivity**: Measure the number of hires made by each recruiter within a certain period.
- **Candidate-to-Interview Ratio**: The number of candidates needed to secure an interview.
- **Interview-to-Hire Ratio**: The number of interviews needed to make a hire.
